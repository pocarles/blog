  <h1>Pierre-Olivierâ€™s Thoughts</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">For as long as I can remember, I've always written. First for myself, primarily. Yet I've always published what I intended only for my own eyes.

Because the simple knowledge that I would be read forced me toward a minimum of care and rigor.

Today, I no longer have a blog in the traditional sense, so what I publish going forward will find its home here. I hope these thoughts and ideas prove useful to you.

The act of writing compels honesty with your ideas and with yourself.

I'm always interested to hear how these ideas land with others. Please feel free to share your thoughts.</p>
